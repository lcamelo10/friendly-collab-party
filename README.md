# iWOMEN in ARC: International Women in Advanced Research Computing

Improving accessibility and awareness to Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and Research Data Management (RDM) for International Women Students Engaged in Genomics Research in Montr√©al.

# Empowering International Women in Genomics: Addressing Barriers to Research Resources and Inclusion in Academia 

The complexity of academic and administrative systems can be challenging for international graduate students. This includes accessing research tools provided independently from their institutions. Additionally, immigration brings challenges like language barriers and cultural shocks, which hinder learning and adaptation. Adapting to tools and platforms used can also be difficult due to differences in research cultures compared to their home countries, particularly for students from middle and low-income countries.

Furthermore, international students who self-identify as women might face gender bias in academia, which can manifest as imposter syndrome and, combined with the language barrier, less assertive communication, limiting their access to mentorship and resources. Also, lack of support networks that provide safe learning spaces can be discouraging.

Addressing the needs of this equity-seeking group will create safe spaces for learning, communication, and resource access which could enhance their careers. Awareness of Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) will provide them with services, resources, and opportunities crucial for their research, academic success, and career development. Particularly in the genomics research field, which involves analyzing vast amounts of data, needing the computational power and efficiency provided by Advanced Research Computing (ARC). For instance, access to High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources enables students to perform complex simulations and data analysis critical for their research.

Ensuring that international women students engaged in research have access to HPC is essential for fostering diverse perspectives and innovations in the genomics research community.

## Objectives
- **Increasing Outreach and Awareness:** Develop outreach programs to inform international women students about the availability and benefits of using HPC in their research project.
- **Enhancing Accessibility through mentorship and training:** Provide technical and non-technical support to help international women students effectively use HPC resources.
- **Building inclusive communities:** Foster an inclusive environment through mentorship, community building, and collaboration opportunities.

### Activities
- Conduct a comprehensive survey to understand the awareness and needs of international women students regarding High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources.
- Recruitment of mentors for the program
- Develop and distribute multilingual informational materials through university channels, social media, and student-led organizations.
- Develop comprehensive multilingual training material (ex. resource guides, slides) and share them with the community on platforms like Slack, GitHub, and Email.
- Organize monthly workshops highlighting the importance of ARC and RDM in various research fields and hold the 2 in person small social events.
- Closure and networking event

ANY international student in Montreal is welcomed to reach out to me either if they are interested in being mentees or mentors.
